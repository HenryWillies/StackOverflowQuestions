All questions that is still public on Stack Overflow are listed here, including the titles I suggest to be added, since I can no longer edit.

## What's this reposutory for?

I want to teach everyone using Stack Overflow, and I also want to moderate the content of the questions, including grammar, proper style, and formatting. I'm mostly active on older questions, so I'm starting there.

## What does this repository contain?

For now, it has a HTML and CSS file, showing the certain titles I would like to add on the questions.

### What is Stack Overflow?

It is a Q&A site by Stack Exchange for programming (there are some other uses, but I only specified the one I'm up to). For more info, visit the [Help Center](https://stackoverflow.com/help) of their site and the [tour page](https://stackoverflow.com/tour).
